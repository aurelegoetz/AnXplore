Tetrahedral mesh dataset for CFD/FSI simulations of idealized sidewall intracranial aneurysms.
You can find detailed information about the dataset creation in our upcoming publication.
Cases A, B, C, and R have been thoroughly examined in [Goetz et al. 2024](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/11/3/269) and correspond to cases 59, 89, and 8 of the full dataset.
