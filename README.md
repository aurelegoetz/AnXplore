# AnXplore
Tetrahedral mesh dataset for CFD/FSI simulations of idealized sidewall intracranial aneurysms.
You can find detailed information about the dataset creation and analysis through Fluid-Structure Interaction simulations in [AnXplore: a comprehensive fluid-structure interaction study of 101 intracranial aneurysms](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/bioengineering-and-biotechnology/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2024.1433811/full?utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field&journalName=Frontiers_in_Bioengineering_and_Biotechnology&id=1433811).
Cases A, B, C, and R have also been thoroughly examined in [Analysis of Intracranial Aneurysm Haemodynamics Altered by Wall Movement](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/11/3/269) and correspond to cases 59, 89, and 8 of the full dataset.

This project has been funded by the European Union (ERC, CURE, 101045042).
